"""
given
b = base of triangle
a = area of triangle

give h the smallest possible height

I'm going to assume an equilateral triangle has the smallest possible height


Note, they only want it where height, base and area are integers

"""


import math

b,a = input().split()
b,a = int(b),int(b)

height = int((area*2)/base)
    return height
